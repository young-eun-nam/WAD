Wavelet Analysis with Improved CNN

[Abstract]
Anomaly detection and classification for ECG time-series data is one of the most crucial tasks in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. In order to diagnose arrhythmias, it is necessary to analyze the ECG time-series data with the characteristics of rhythmic, sequential, and unbalanced abnormal ratios. We propose two components to anomaly detection in MIT-BIH ECG data. One of the components is the wavelet analysis to catch the detailed features of the signal. We decompose the original ECG signals and reconstruct them to the wavelet transformed signals, so it makes the model effectively reduce the influence of the noise. The second component is the improved CNN model architecture that accelerates the effect of the anomaly detection performance. Improved CNN architecture makes the model extract useful features for anomaly detection. Our model is confirmed through experiments by combining the above two components, wavelet analysis, and improved CNN model architecture, the performance highly outperforms other deep learning based state-of-the-art baseline methods. Furthermore, we prove the effectiveness of each component by ablation studies.
